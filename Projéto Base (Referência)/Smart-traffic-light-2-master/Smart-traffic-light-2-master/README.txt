- Python code of improved version 3 (detection of priority vehicles) (traffic_modif3.py)- PPT presentation of the project My feedback regarding :- Work done : 
The tutorial version is working correctly after some modifications made by us. 
Moreover, two improvements were added : the automatic calibration of roads, and the detection of priority vehicles. 
  - Difficulties : 
Lots of connections (welding)
Time was short
- Time invested : 
4 lab sessions (4x4 hours)
Time for building the structure and the roads
Time for making connections (welding)
Time for making videos and montage
 - Tutorial original quality and working tutorial : 
Original code was only working with PiCamera and detection was not very accurate. 
Original code was working specifically for his structure (if roads are disposed differently, this code does not work anymore). 
- Added Value :Project working with any USB webcam camera
Detection of cars more accurate
Automatic calibration of roads
Detection of priority vehicles
